--------------------
This is a collection of a few python scripts I have written and used during my PhD. 

I've generalized some of this to serve as examples rather than for the specific problems they were written to address. I'm not sure how useful these will be to others, but feel use/dstribute. 

Brief descriptions:
--------------------
  * signalProcessingExamples.py: simple examples of conducting a qunatitative, 1D, fast Fourier transform (FFT) of a continuous time-domain signal. Additionally are shown general methods for calculating power spectrum density (PSD) of the same signal using the periodogram or Welch's methods. (uses matplotlib, numpy, scipy, and math)  

 * imageProcessingExamples.py: basic examples for image processing and filtering (spline, convolved, guassian). (uses matplotlib, numpy, and scipy)
