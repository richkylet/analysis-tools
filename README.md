--------------------
This is a collection of a few python scripts I have written and used during my PhD. 

I've generalized some of this to serve as examples rather than for the specific problems they were written to address. I'm not sure how useful these will be to others, but feel use/dstribute. 

Brief descriptions:
--------------------
  * #fft_example.py#: simple example of conducting a qunatitative, fast Fourier transform of a time-domain signal. (requires matplotlib, numpy and math)
